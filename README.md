How to attach an javascript to html file:

<script src = "js/main.js"></script>

furthermore in main.js file the content is :
alert("Krzys");
document.body.innerHTML = "This is some content";


Whether I want to write something in document use "document.write" or make some statements I do this :
document.body.innerHTML = "This is some content ";
var person = "Marcin";
var woman = "Andy";
if(person == "Daniel")
{alert("The variable person is fine");}

document.write (person);
document.write (" has pro skills")

In javaScript we are able to make an array which contains different variable types as elements! wowz :
var person = {name:"Marcin", numberOfLegs:"3", secondName "Maciej"};
